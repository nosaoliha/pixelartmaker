# Pixel Art Maker

- A single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!
- A starter code is given with HTML and CSS files to build the application.
- You will write a `JS code` that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply **colors** to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

## Users should be able to:

- Dynamically set the size of the table as an **_N_ by _M_ grid**.
- Choose a color by clicking a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
- Your primary task is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

## Skills Needed

Front-end programming skills including:
- Defining variables with `const and let`.
- Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object.
- Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners.
- Writing nested loops and using loop variables.
